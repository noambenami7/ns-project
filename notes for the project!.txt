notes for the project!

1. I have only one problam that i couldnt figer out its about the lissening of connections. if there was no connecion when you start the script the scirpt would stop work after        
   starting the services, but if you will connect befor runing the script its would work great and will lisening antill you will stop the script.
   ( I have send you a screenshot )

2. All the deatils about the nmap and the activity log will be save in files if you want to search inside them.
